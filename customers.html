					<h2>Data or BI Leaders</h2>

				<div>
					<h2>Travel</h2>
					<p>When it comes to travel – everyone has preferences. As you capture this data, are you capitalizing on those preferences before, during and after the pathway to purchase? For example, you might be able to access their previous booking during their current, real-time booking indicating that the last time they secured this very trip they watched Bravo on your in-flight entertainment service for 2.5 hours. And perhaps, with a little help sorting out data, you could reference it during the checkout process – helping to build your loyalty, while showing them you want to get to know them. With the right data strategy, your first-class experience has finally arrived.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="industry">
					<div class="use-case">
						<h3>Rental Cars</h3>
						<p>When it comes to renting a car it’s all about customer preferences. Will they need a larger car to accommodate for the family vacation or do they want to test out the latest technology? Are they looking for a luxury car to impress or are they cost-conscious? Do they always book a black car with a moonroof or a red convertible with two-doors?</p> 

						<p>Or…perhaps it’s time to purchase a new fleet of vehicles, but you don’t know where to start. While you probably have all of this data sitting in a bucket somewhere, you might not be using it to make the best decisions possible when it comes to data intelligence.</p> 

						<p>Instead of sending unstructured, generic emails without much input, take a few moments to dream about how much more you can accomplish with the right data strategy, framework, and execution. Your customers will become your strongest advocate, and before you know it, will be driving off in a style accommodated to all of their preferences.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="use-case">
						<h3>Airlines</h3>
						<p>Think for a moment just how much data you collect when your customers are booking a flight with your airline. You have baseline data, such as dates of travel, trip duration, nonstop, preferred airport departure, isle/window, etc. And you also have small pieces of information, such as the type of credit card used or how many times they went back to try different dates, that when looked at holistically, might offer deep insights that may have been looked over otherwise.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="use-case">
					<h3>Hospitality</h3>
						<p>Imagine a simple scenario: You’re going through your data on one customer. 14 trips last year (11 for business and 3 for leisure), always nonsmoking (with a balcony) and a minimum room service spend of $30. As you start to dig deeper, you find that when they’re traveling for work their room service bill is 1.7x higher on average than when they travel for leisure. That gives you the idea to perform the same analysis on all customers with 10+ stays in a year. You find out that when guests are traveling for work, they spend more. Not everyone in this category is spending more though – so you set up a marketing campaign, run it for one month and see what happens. Eventually, you begin to convert guests and suddenly, through a simple data find have increased your revenue by approximately 2x for this segment. That’s a data strategy at work.</p>

						<p>When it comes to travel hospitality, the experience of your guests is crucial. And the amount of data that you can collect is huge. From guest check-ins on social media to how long your guests wait to book their room before their trip, there is a lot of business intelligence to uncover. But sometimes bridging the gap between IT, marketing, sales, finances, and operations can be a huge challenge and then making sense of it can be even harder. Instead of giving customers a brilliant, first-class experience, they’re left with a clunky, challenging system. It’s finally time for that to change. Give your guests an experience they’ll never forget.</p>

				<h2>Automotive</h2>
				<div class="industry">
					<div class="use-case">
						<h3>Dealership Customer Experience</h3>
						<p>Buying a car is a special time. In order to help capture your buyer’s attention, you’ll have to use your data as your competitive advantage. The buyer’s journey can start and end in a variety of touchpoints. While it may begin as a vision for a luxury sedan with high-end technology, it might transform into the need for a new car after an accident, when suddenly safety is now the top priority. As a buyer’s needs shift, your data should be kept up to help manage every consumer touchpoint throughout the sale.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Retail</h2>
				<div class="industry">
					<div class="use-case">
						<h3>Enterprise Analytics</h3>
						<p>Due to the rapid expansion of online, e-commerce businesses, the state of retail has changed extensively over the past decade. Data strategy, collection, and analysis have become more important than ever to help brands uncover deep insights for a holistic data strategy. Think for a moment of every piece of data you’re able to collect on your customers and how that data can be used to lead to a complete digital transformation of your business in every area.</p>
						<h3>Customer Experience</h3>
						<p>From in-store to online to loyalty programs, your customer’s experience should be seamless, integrated, and consistent, and it all begins with your data. Data is your lifeblood to a holistic, unified experience to drive brand loyalty, increase revenue, and improve efficiencies in every way. Your data should be architected in a way to promote a single source of truth, so all corporate departments, stores, and online spaces are unified with a single mission for success.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Technology Enabled Services</h2>
				<div class="industry">
					<div class="use-case">
						<h3>Data Monetization</h3>
						<p>You cannot succeed in business without your customers – and it all begins with the data you collect on them. Everywhere you turn you have a new piece of data that can be captured. From the number of emails they’re opening to the time spent on your website to how quickly you’re able to run reports and solve their problems. How are you monetizing this data outside your internal customers?</p>
